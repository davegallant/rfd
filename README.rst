    | - [0] For those worried about credit ratings, according to Boworell, my credit score rose by 44 points since last month.  I did absolutely nothing except open 3 Koodo lines all with medium tabs and I paid off 1 in full the very next day (Shaner)

    I've read that the port can only be used once now, but does it matter which phone number is ported in? (kid_icarus)

    3 days? Wow. I just tried calling Koodo. Level 1 rep didn't know anything about the promo. Supervisor didn't know details about the promo either. But he connected to web store and said he could not activate this plan unless I port my number. Even though it doesn't state you must compete a port when adding this promo, that they completed a credit check, charged me, and I even have a receipt they emailed me for the transaction including the promo details, but now this "supervisor" won't honour it without a port. Would not budge. I ended up hanging up because the supervisor was getting unprofessional.

    What did the supervisor say? Maybe you'll have better luck calling webstore tomorrow.

    All they have to do is search SIM card # in database it should link to an account.

    Supervisor wasn't helpful, quoted my previous post above. (rolomonster)
